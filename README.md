# 2048 in Python
- Features custom interfaces via curses and pygame (WIP)
- You may create your own interfaces without digging into mechanics of game
- My first project in Python, I'm looking forward for your suggestions and critisism

# Dependencies
- curses (as far as I know, it's default in Python3)
- pygame (via pip or https://github.com/pygame/pygame)
- Python 3.3 (I used lists' copy() method a lot)
